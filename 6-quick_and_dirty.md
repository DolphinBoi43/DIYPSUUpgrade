If you haven't already go ahead and readup on [this page about PSUs](2-psu_4_dummy.md) and figure out what [type of PSU](3-types_of_psus.md) you have or will be using.

The thinking behind this method is get it done, and get it working. This will involve : 
1. **Figuring out the pinout** on the PSU originally in the computer, and the new PSU that you will installing or using in parallel with.
2. **Making power cables** that will work with both the PSU and computer
3. **Testing the system** before installing any other components
4. **Storing away the mess** that will for sure be created
5. **Using your new PSU** and why you should keep an eye on it

If you still want to continue with project, go ahead and take the next step and make sure your grounded.
