# How to Upgrade/Replace PSU in a not custom PC 
#### *This a amateurs attempt to create a helpful guide for a niche topic/hobby so please, use best judgement and do not attempt anything in this guide if you don't own atleast a multimeter and a working knowledge or understanding of electricity and circuits.*
This is a basic how-to/DIY guide to understanding how a basic home computer/desktop is powered by a PSU and how said PSU (that is usually proprietary) can be replaced with another PSU (commericially avaible) and made compatible with a home computer/desktop from a computer company that may or may not want to make it easier for consumers to modify and repair products that they purchased. This guide will hopefully allow for those us that got a small budget and old/used hardware that still works to give new life or extend the life of PC that can still serve a purpose.
